This is an experiment lab for doing stuff with Vision Pro Hand tracking.

I wanted to take some of the concepts from [the LeapC SDK](https://docs.ultraleap.com/api-reference/tracking-api/leapc-guide.html) and make some things easier to use with hand tracking in Vision OS.

At the moment, you get a Control Panel to style the hand skeleton and a movable Hand Tracking Visualizer, similar to the Ultraleap Unity Control Panel hands.
